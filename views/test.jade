        li Welcome to session TEST! In this session you will be working with #[strong GPT-3], a language model developed by OpenAI.
        li New predictive text is generated as soon as you type a period to end a sentence. 
        li You may have to wait a bit for the input to be sent to the Heroku server which forwards the request to the OpenAI server. The response returns in the reverse order.
        li In this demo, no data is written to the database.
        li I've found that the model excels at generating more creative text.
        li Please try and break it ðŸ˜Š .
