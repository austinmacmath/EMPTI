        li Welcome to session TEST! In this session you will be working with #[strong GPT-3], a language model developed by OpenAI.
        li New predictive text is generated as soon as you type a period to end a sentence. 
        li You may have to wait a bit for the input to be sent to the Heroku server which forwards the request to the OpenAI server. The response returns in the reverse order.
        li In this demo, no data is written to the database.
        li I've found that the model excels at generating more creative text.
        li Please try and break it ðŸ˜Š .

          | Hi friend!

          | I hope all is well. Itâ€™s been a while since weâ€™ve caught up so Iâ€™m just checking in. How are things? Whatâ€™s new? How is your family? Since the last time we talked, Iâ€™ve reorganized my home workspace about three times, binge-watched too many shows on Netflix, and tried a whole lot of new recipes to escape boredom. So, if you have any show recommendations or food ideas please send them my way. The other day I was reminiscing about our past summer escapades. Have you gotten to go anywhere or do anything cool over summer? If so, let me know! You know Iâ€™m always trying to add to my adventure list. Also, Iâ€™ll be in town over the holidays. Let me know if you are free at all to grab coffee. Miss you old friend!
