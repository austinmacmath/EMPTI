        li Welcome to session #{order}! In this session, you will use #[strong CS Predictor] to respond to 4 emails.
        li The #[strong writing habits questionnaire] you completed earlier will NOT be used when working with #[strong CS Predictor] in this session.
        li #[strong CS Predictor] is developed by a group of Computer Science (CS) junior students at UC Santa Barbara as a final project in their AI Programming course. It provides you with typing suggestions that a majority of users would have typed based on the probability model.
        li Imagine as if someone has sent the email below to you and respond to the message as authentically as possible. 
        li If a gray text appears after your cursor, you have the option to pressing the TAB key on the left side of your keyboard to autocomplete #[strong CS Predictorâ€™s] suggestion. 
        li In the live page (not this tutorial), your response to each email must be at least 100 words in order to submit.
        li Once you understand how to interact with the #[strong CS Predictor], please click the SEND button to submit your and progress to the next email.
